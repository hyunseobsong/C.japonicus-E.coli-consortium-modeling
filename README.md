# C.japonicus-E.coli-consortium-modeling

In this repository, you will find two MATLAB .mlx files that include code to perform parsimonious FBA for C. japonicus isolate and a community model of C. japonicus and E. coli.

The .mat files are models of C. japonicus and the community model as built in KBase. To find more information on these model constructions, you can see an overview at: https://kbase.us/n/188503/11/. This narrative has the finalized versions of the C. japonicus and E. coli models and shows simulated growths on multiple media types. To see the individual isolate constructions itself, you can find the construction of E. coli at https://kbase.us/n/162658/168/  and the construction of C. japonicus at https://kbase.us/n/161465/162/.
